# Project Roadmap

## Scope

This application is intended to allow:
- Generation and download of multi-file software code project structures based on project templates
  - Exposed via HTTP interface
  - Template context could be dynamically expanded
- Retrieval of project templates through a variety of configurable storage mechanisms
  - Initial version will support templates included in the classpath
  - Possible future improvements:
    - Retrieve from public URL
    - Retrieve from source control 
- Discovery of the types of projects that can be generated by the application
  - Exposed via HTTP interface

## Current State

Currently the application has the following characteristics:
- Each project type is registered in code
- Code is written to control project creation logic
- Each project creator is responsible for:
  - Determining which files to create and how to create them (direct copy, template transformation, combining templates)
  - Creating a directory structure and project files on disk in a known location
- The directory structure that is created is zipped and returned
- A clean up process is scheduled to remove that directory structure

The current implementation provides the maximum amount of flexibility when creating projects, because any logic can be coded to describe exactly how to generate the project. However, this has the following shortcomings:
- Adding or modifying project templates is difficult without thorough understanding of internals
- Project templates are tightly coupled with code, meaning a change to a template often requires a rebuild
 
The current flow for creating a new project is shown below:
